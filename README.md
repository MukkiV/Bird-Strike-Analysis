🧩 Project Overview
This Tableau project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of global bird strike incidents (2000–2013) to identify trends, assess safety risks, and recommend effective strategies to improve aviation safety and operational efficiency.

The analysis focuses on understanding when, where, and how bird strikes occur — and how airlines and airports can minimize financial, safety, and environmental impacts through data insights.

🎯 Project Objectives
Safety Improvements – Identify critical flight phases and risk patterns for better hazard mitigation.

Regulatory Compliance – Track and improve accuracy in reporting and preventive measures.

Cost Reduction – Analyze financial losses across airlines and years to optimize maintenance efforts.

Wildlife Conservation – Understand species most involved in strikes and promote eco-friendly prevention.

Operational Efficiency – Reduce flight disruptions, delays, and maintenance time due to strikes.

📊 Dashboards Created
Safety Improvements Dashboard – Shows flight phases most vulnerable to bird strikes.

Wildlife Conservation Dashboard – Identifies top species involved and outcome severity.

Operational Efficiency Dashboard – Highlights disruptions, top affected states, and flight impact.

Cost Reduction Dashboard – Breaks down yearly financial losses and airline-wise costs.

Regulatory Compliance Dashboard – Analyzes improvement in reporting and sky condition patterns.

KPI & Strategic Insights Dashboard – Displays total strikes, injuries, cost metrics, and actionable insights.

📈 Key Findings
✈️ Safety Improvements
Approach and Landing phases show the highest number of bird strikes.

Over 24,000+ incidents occurred during the approach phase, demanding priority safety actions.

🐦 Wildlife Conservation
Unknown small birds, starlings, and pigeons are most frequently involved.

Over 68,000 total strikes and 345 species recorded.

⚙️ Operational Efficiency
California, Texas, and Florida reported the most incidents.

Majority of strikes caused no immediate impact, but required inspections and caused schedule delays.

💰 Cost Reduction
Total estimated industry loss: $140+ million (2000–2013).

Business and United Airlines accounted for the highest strike-related costs.

🌤️ Regulatory Compliance
Reporting quality and frequency improved steadily until 2011.

Surprisingly, 47% of strikes occurred under clear sky conditions, suggesting need for radar-based monitoring.

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Metric Value Total Strikes Recorded 68,649 Unique Species Involved 345 People Injured 21 Highest Strike Location (Dallas/Fort Worth) 2,933 Average Annual Cost $272,727 Frequent Sky Condition 47.4% under No Cloud conditions

💡 Strategic Recommendations
Habitat Management – Reduce nesting and feeding grounds around airports.

Enhanced Monitoring – Install bird-detection radar at high-risk airports.

Pilot Training – Conduct mandatory hazard awareness and response sessions.

Operational Focus – Apply preventive measures during Approach and Landing phases.

Inspection Protocols – Standardize post-strike inspections regardless of impact severity.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
