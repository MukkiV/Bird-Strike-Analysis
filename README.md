📈 Key Findings
✈️ Safety Improvements

Approach and Landing phases show the highest strike frequency.

24,000+ incidents occurred during approach alone.

🐦 Wildlife Conservation

Unknown small birds, starlings, and pigeons were most frequently involved.

68,000+ total strikes and 345 species recorded.

⚙️ Operational Efficiency

California, Texas, and Florida reported the highest number of incidents.

Most strikes caused no immediate impact but required inspections and led to delays.

💰 Cost Reduction

Total estimated industry loss: $140+ million (2000–2013).

Business and United Airlines accounted for the highest repair and operational costs.

🌤️ Regulatory Compliance

Reporting improved steadily until 2011.

47% of strikes occurred under clear skies, showing need for radar-based systems.

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Metric	Value
Total Strikes Recorded	68,649
Unique Species Involved	345
People Injured	21
Highest Recorded Location	2,933 (Dallas/Fort Worth)
Average Annual Cost	$272,727
Most Frequent Sky Condition	47.4% under clear/no-cloud conditions
💡 Strategic Recommendations

Habitat Management: Reduce nesting and feeding grounds near airports.

Enhanced Monitoring: Implement bird-detection radar at high-risk airports.

Pilot Training: Train pilots for hazard recognition and response.

Operational Focus: Prioritize preventive measures during approach and landing.

Inspection Protocols: Standardize post-strike inspections regardless of severity.
